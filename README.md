####This app is being worked on (developpement on hold from April 28th to May 1st 2016)

This app (iOS only currently) permits to students of the *École d'Éducation internationale* of McMasterville, Quebec aka *ÉÉI* to make bibliographic references automagically. It currently doesn't work, as it's being developed.

**Note :** This app is only tested in iOS for the moment. Android will be tested later.
